        <p>Kia ora, I'm Jessie! I'm excited to be part of the Aihe intake for Dev Academy in 2022.</p>
        <p> I'm based in Christchurch and live with three cats, two bunnies and one husband!</p> 
        <p>You can read more about me and my learning journey in my blog posts and the About page. </p>

          <h1>Learning Plan</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="blog-preview">
          <h2> What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h2>
            <p>I want to be a senior product manager at my work (or another tech company). I’ve learned I love being in product and would love the opportunity to have higher impact and let my understanding of merchant needs combine with my technical skills to improve our offering.</p> <p>My next steps are to complete this course, move into a product owner role and learn, learn, learn.</p>

          <h2>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h2>
            <p></p>My strengths are motivation and desire to learn. I have good perseverance and I really want to learn the information and learn it well.</p> <p>My limitations are related to scoping and slowing down. I have a tendency to rush into things before really stopping and analysing the best ways to tackle them. This can lead to missing key concepts or having to repeat work later.</p>

          <h2>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h2>
            <p>As mentioned above, the ability to stop, slow down and assess. <p>I do things at a mile a minute at work and this is a habit I need to break in order to be effective in any future product management roles. I would like to focus on scoping out and planning more, as well as keeping notes of what’s happening - rather than keeping it all in my head.</p>
            <p>I would also like to get better at explaining technical or complicated concepts in simple terms. Again, it's one of those things that I get all caught up in my own head and then having to explain it to someone is opening a whole can of worms... I need to figure out which worm to focus on!</p>

          <h2>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. </h2>
            <p>If I’m getting really stuck or confused on a problem/concept, I’ll give myself 45 minutes max to try work it out - no more than that, otherwise I know the frustration gets emotional and I’ll start to feel negatively about my abilities. I’ll then reach out to get support on Discord and see if someone can help. If this isn’t available immedi  ately I’ll make myself put the laptop down and change scenery. I like gardening and it’s a good time of year for it, so half an hour in the garden is a good way to clear my head. It can also allow me to mull over the issue in a different environment without the same pressure, which may make things click.</p> 
            <p>Keeping active in general is something I plan to do with this course, along with having a routine - a time I start and a time I stop. If I get stressed I’m likely to start comparing myself to others and feeling like I’m falling behind. If so, I’ll check in with the facilitators to get a gut check from their end - sometimes I’m hardest on myself and may actually be okay. Something else I’ve started doing and will continue is to try help others that post in the channels, especially when it’s after hours. I’ve found it helps to solidify my learning and makes me feel part of a team at the same time.</p>

          <h2>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h2>
            <p>Timely responses to requests for help during working hours and feedback on my progress.</p> <p>It’s also nice to have them create meetings that allow our home groups to get to know each other more.</p>

          <h2>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things.</h2>
          <p>Most days will be clear and bootcamp will be the main priority, but I have a few things planned in the next couple of months:</p>
            <ul>
              <li> 30th October - going to Palmerston North for a family birthday.</li>
              <li>4th November appointment (trying to change this!)</li>
              <li>8th November appointment in the afternoon</li>
              <li>17th - 22nd November: Family staying with us</li>
            </ul>

                 <h3>Why is it important to understand neuroplasticity?</h3>
                  <p>A big benefit of understanding neuroplasticity is gaining the knowledge that repetition and exposure to a concept that makes a person learn something - not an innate, fixed level of intelligence.</p>
                    
                  <p>This gives hope that you can become competent (or even great!) at something - but that it’s normal to not understand it at the beginning.

                <h3>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h3>
                <p>Emotional intelligence is the ability to recognise your emotions and react to them in a logical, proactive way versus reacting in a negative way that can harm ourselves or others. It’s when you recognise and to a degree control your emotions, rather than them controlling you.</p>

                <p>Emotional intelligence also applies for interactions with others; being able to understand how they're feeling, listen to them and relate to their emotions about something.</p>

                <h3>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>
                <p>I want to be a senior product manager at my work (or another tech company). I’ve learned I love being in product and would love the opportunity to have higher impact and let my understanding of merchant needs combine with my technical skills to improve our offering.</p>
                  
                <p>My next steps are to complete this course, move into a product owner role and learn, learn, learn.</p>

                  <p>Prior to working in tech, I was an early childhood teacher for 5 years. It’s a challenging job and very stressful, but can also be very rewarding.</p>

                  <p>Not long after I finished my qualification, I started working at a center that I found had very poor practice. Teachers would routinely get up in small children’s faces, grab them by the shoulders and yell at them - for things like a newly-toilet trained two-year-old having an accident.</p>

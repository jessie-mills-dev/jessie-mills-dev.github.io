            <p>Kia ora, I'm Jessie! I'm excited to be part of the Aihe intake for Dev Academy in 2022.</p>
            <p> I'm based in Christchurch and live with three cats, two bunnies and one husband!</p> 
            <p>You can read more about me and my learning journey in my blog posts and the About page. </p>

                  <h3>Hello! I'm Jessie.</h3> 
                  <p>I grew up in Palmy, but moved to Auckland and then Wellington before settling in Christchurch in mid 2021.</p>

                  <p>I work at a US-based tech company called Recharge (the only Kiwi! Hope we hire more soon!) and have been there since July 2020. I worked at Shopify before then, and it was at Shopify I first tried coding.</p>

                  <p>I've always gotten stuck at JavaScript, and never had the time to devote to learning it. I'm fortunate my work is giving me time off to learn! I'm hoping that when I return to work I'll be able to increase the impact I can have on the company, ideally in a product ownership role.</p>
                  
                  <p>I have a lot of hobbies! Sewing, cross-stitch, gardening and caring for my indoor plants usually take up a lot of my time - not so much at the moment though, not enough spare time. I'm also pretty active these days - I used to have some mobility issues due to a foot problem. That's since been resolved, and now I'm using my feet as much as I can! We have a treadmill and I like to go for walks around my little suburb.</p>

                  <p>My husband Chris and I have five beautiful furbabies! You can read more about them on <a href="../Pets/pets.html">Pets page.</a></p>
